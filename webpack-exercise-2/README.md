![Web Page](https://github.com/janakanuwan/web-page-design/blob/master/modularity-example-3/My%20Super%20Heros.png)

### Instructions
1. Create a directory in the format  `Tutorial4_<MATRIC_NUMBER>`.
2. Initialize your project using `npm` inside that directory. Use **your name** as the author and **tutorial4-exercise-<MATRIC_NUMBER>** (e.g. _tutorial4-exercise-a0123456b_) as the name of the project (i.e. `package name`). You will compress this directory and upload it to IVLE.





**DO NOT** include the `node_modules` directory in final compressed files. (Why? some libraries are platform dependent and they take considerable space)

## Deliverables:
- The **project folder** with name `Tutorial4_<MATRIC_NUMBER>`
- An **instruction file** on how to the run the code (e.g. _README.md_ file) **inside** your _project folder_

## Submitting Exercise
All deliverables should be archived into a .zip file with the following naming convention:
```
Tutorial4_<MATRIC_NUMBER>.zip
```
submitted to the IVLE "Tutorial 4 Exercise" workbin ("Files" > "Tutorials" > "Tutorial 4 Exercise") before March 15, 2019, 23:59.
